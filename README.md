Hi Reader! this is a better version of the vex V5 drivetrain with support for a whole lot more advanced topics like PID using odom sensors, and we plan to also implement odometry tracking. 

it should allow you to create a drivetrain object in your main file to control your robot's drivebase with a bunch of commands that are built into the class, and take a lot of complexity out of your main program files
and make your autonomous routines simpler to write. features, documentation and more will be published in this document as development continues.
