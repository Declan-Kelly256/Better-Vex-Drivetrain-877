Project Scope

Plug & play for 2.5 setups 

Barebones: 

wheels, and an IMU

inputs needed
    components
        motor objs , IMU obj 
    Measurements 
        WheelRadius, wheelWidth (horizontal distance from other wheel well)? 
odom: differentiation between the two odom modes will be handled within the odom math class
    Odom 1: 3 three tracking wheels and no IMU 
        Components 
            motors, and odom sensors 
        Measurments 
            all three odom sensor offsets from the tracking center 

    Odom 2: 2 Tracking wheels and 1 IMU
        Components 
            motors, two odom wheels and IMU 
        Measurements:
            odom wheel offsets from tacking center 

ideas:

allow input of two IMU's to average data? 


should be plug and play based off the the constructors used for the thingy
